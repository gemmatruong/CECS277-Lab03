# 🧩 Maze Solver (Python Console Game) — Lab 04

A Python console-based maze game where the player navigates from the starting point (`s`) to the finish (`f`) by moving north, south, east, or west through a maze loaded from a file.

- The player's current position is displayed as **`X`**.
- Walls are represented by **`*`** and cannot be crossed.
